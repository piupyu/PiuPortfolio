    <h1>About</h1>
    <h2>Hello World!</h2>
    <p>
      I'm a Software Engineer who loves to explore everything that technology
      can provide to us. I currently work as a Full Stack developer using Java
      and Angular. In the same way, I must say that I'm a big fan of front-end
      development. Also, I study Information Systems and have developed some
      interesting projects at university, focusing on User Experience and Agile
      software development. In my free time, I like to play video games and
      study about Artificial Intelligence and how it can help people.
